# DSCI-553-Data-Mining
Algorithms and techniques of Data Mining and Machine Learning for analyzing massive datasets. Emphasis on system building with Spark. Case studies and applications. 

Homework 1: Get familar with spark and working with RDD. Functions include using lambda (higher order function), map, flatmap, count, filter, distinct, reduceByKey, takeOrdered.

Homework 2: Implement the SON Algorithm using the Spark Framework. You will develop a program to find frequent itemsets in two datasets, one simulated dataset and one real-world generated dataset. The goal of this assignment is to apply the algorithms you have learned in class on large datasets more efficiently in a distributed environment.

Homework 3: The goal is to familiarize you with Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), and different types of collaborative-filtering recommendation systems.

Homework 4: Explore the spark GraphFrames library as well as implement your own Girvan-Newman algorithm using the Spark Framework to detect communities in graphs. You will use the ub_sample_data.csv dataset to find users who have similar business tastes. The goal of this assignment is to help you understand how to use the Girvan-Newman algorithm to detect communities in an efficient way within a distributed environment.

Homework 5: Implement three streaming algorithms. In the first two tasks, you will generate a simulated data stream with the Yelp dataset and implement the Bloom Filtering and Flajolet-Martin algorithm. In the third task, you will do some analysis using Fixed Size Sample (Reservoir Sampling).

Homework 6: Implement the Bradley-Fayyad-Reina (BFR) algorithm. The goal is to let you be familiar with the process of clustering in general and various distance measurements. The datasets you are going to use is synthetic dataset.

Project: In this competition project, you need to improve the performance of your recommendation system from Assignment 3. You can use any method (like the hybrid recommendation systems) to improve the prediction accuracy and efficiency.
